export const BIO = [
  "Bruno Blasco - Full Stack Web Developer from Concordia, Entre R√≠os (Born on May 24, 1999)",
  "I‚Äôm a web developer passionate about solving issues one line at a time and crafting user-friendly experiences. With a strong foundation in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js, I've spent the last two years sharpening my skills in responsive development, experimenting with tools such as Sass, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and back-end frameworks like Express and NestJS. My database experience includes working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL, allowing me to build full-stack applications that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.",
  "I also bring a unique perspective to development through my graphic design skills using Photoshop and Illustrator, ensuring that my applications not only work well but also look great.",
  "My work experience includes time at Extraberries, where I provided support in the systems area and worked as an administrative assistant. This role taught me the value of teamwork, organization, and effective communication - skills that are equally important in development.",
  "Before diving into the tech world, I studied psychology for four years, which has shaped how I approach human-computer interaction and problem-solving. As a native Spanish speaker with a B1 level in English after three years of formal study, I'm always excited to collaborate with diverse teams and tackle new challenges.",
  "I'm not an expert, but I'm committed to lifelong learning. In this ever-evolving field, there‚Äôs always something new to discover, and I am thrilled to be a part of this journey. I'm looking forward to the future and the opportunities it holds!",
